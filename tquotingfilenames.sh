# WARNING:  Note though that filenames still can't include any control
# characters and be handled safely!  At minimum the kernel should not
# permit control characters in filenames, as per:

#	http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html
#
# In theory the kernel could/should also prevent (or escape?)
# filenames that arenâ€™t a valid UTF-8 encoding.

# first eliminate space from IFS....
