/*
 * Derived from code posted to LinkedIN by Mart√≠n Knoblauch Revuelta.
 *
 * multifork() and multiwait() are helper functions for creating a number of
 * child processes and making them run, while ensuring that either:
 *
 *	a) every child is created and gets to continue running
 * or:
 *	b) no one does
 *
 * If fork() fails creating a child process, then the previously created
 * children processes don't get to return from multifork()
 *
 * Note that if a child fails for any reason, including if there's any problem
 * with communicating the start signal to all children, then all we can do is
 * discover the failure(s) using multiwait().
